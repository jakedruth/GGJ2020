# (re)PAIR
## Global Game Jam - 2020

The Global Game Jam is a one of the world's largets game jam event that happens every year. Jammers are given a theme to loosely follow and tasked with making a game in 48 hours. This years theme was **Repair**. A theme about fixing stuff. But we took it to mean pairing up things again.

*(re)Pair* is puzzle game about Noah's ark breaking down and having all of the animals get loose. It is up to the player to re-pair up all of the escaped animals, again. This is done be pushing the same breed of animals together, but watch out! Some animals just can't fight their urge to eat smaller prey. Avoid bringing tasty snacks near these animals, like crocodiles and snakes. Other animals just don't want to move. They would much rather wait around until food comes to them, than be push by the likes of you. You will come across several challenging puzzles and find various pick-ups along the way. 

This Game Jam Project was created using Unity version 2019.3.0f6.
